        <h2 class="st1 text" id="ar">THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE :</h2>
        <p class="text">Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating
            intelligent
            <br>
            machines that can accomplish activities that would normally need human intelligence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="st1 text" id="ari">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE'S FOUR TYPES :</h2>
        <h3 class="text">Limited Memory</h3>
        <p class="text">When gathering information and assessing prospective options, artificial intelligence with
            limited memory can store previous data and predictions,
            essentially peering into the past for indications on what might happen tomorrow.
            Artificial intelligence with limited memory is more complicated and has more possibilities than reactive
            machines.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text">Reactive Machines</h3>
        <p class="text">A reactive machine is guided by the most fundamental AI principles and, as the name suggests, is
            solely capable of perceiving and reacting to the world around it.<br>
            Because a reactive machine lacks memory, it cannot depend on previous experiences to guide real-time
            decision-making.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text">Self-Awareness</h3>
        <p class="text">The ultimate stage for AI to become self-aware will be to build Theory of Mind in artificial
            intelligence, which will happen sometime in the future.<br>
            This type of artificial intelligence is conscious on a human level and is aware of its own presence in the
            world as well as the presence and emotional condition of others.<br>
            It would be able to deduce what others may require based on not just what they say to them, but also how
            they say it.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text">Theory of Mind</h3>
        <p class="text">Theory of Mind is exactly that: a theory. We haven't yet developed the technology and scientific
            capabilities required to advance artificial intelligence to the next level.</p>


        <h2 class="st1 text" id="art">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE EXAMPLES :</h2>
        <p class="text">Siri, Alexa and other smart assistants</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">Self-driving cars</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">Robo-advisors</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">Netflix's recommendations</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">Conversational bots</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">Email spam filters</p>

        <h2 class="st1 text" id="ho">HOW IS AI USED :</h2>
        <p class="text">Jeremy Achin, CEO of DataRobot, opened his keynote at the Japan AI Experience in 2017 by giving
            the following characterization of how AI is used today:</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">
            <q>AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence... Many of these
                artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep
                learning and some of them are powered by very boring things like rules.</q>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">Artificial intelligence can be divided into two categories:</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text">Narrow AI :</h3>
        <p class="text">This type of artificial intelligence, often known as "weak AI," operates in a constrained
            context and is an imitation of human intelligence.
            While narrow AI is frequently focused on executing a specific task very well,
            these machines operate under many more constraints and limits than even the most basic human intelligence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text">Artificial General Intelligence</h3>
        <p class="text">AGI, often known as "Strong AI," is the type of artificial intelligence we see in movies like
            Westworld's machines or Star Trek: The Next Generation's Data.
            AGI is a machine that has general intelligence and can use that intelligence to solve any problem, much like
            a person can.</p>
